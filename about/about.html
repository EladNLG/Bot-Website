        <p>Elad's Pet is eladMLG#5758's project to make a <strong>completely free</strong> Discord bot. You can find him on <a href="https://discordbots.org/bot/295201521191354378">dicordbots.org</a> and try him out on your own server. Or just use an instant invite link <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=295201521191354378&permissions=8&scope=bot" target="_blank">here.</a>
            <br>This bot can also show how hard (and laggy!) it is to host a bot on your own computer without any money. If you are already expirienced with the bot, you know he is mostly offline (like eladMLG#5758 (Add him on Discord!)) unlike famous bots that <i>do</i> have premium, donations and etc.
